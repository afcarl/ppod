! njorak, not-quite-dvorak. Version 1.2
!
! By Pontus Stenetorp
!
! Derived from us dvorak, accesses Swedish characters through
!   altgr or similar combos. Also swaps caps and esc.
! Apply it to an ordinary dvorak keymap using xmodmap.
!
! Lenovo Thinkpad X200 version
!
! still dedicated to spatrik

! Set up Swedish special characters
keycode 43 = d D aring
keycode 44 = h H adiaeresis
keycode 45 = t T odiaeresis

! Swap escape and caps lock
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Escape
keycode 66 = Escape
keycode 9 = Caps_Lock
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Escape

! Lenovo put some silly document forward and backward keys next to the arrow
!   keys, let's use those for page up and page down instead. Home/end would
!   also have been viable alternatives.
keycode 166 = Prior
keycode 167 = Next
