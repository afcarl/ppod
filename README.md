# Public Pod (ppod) #

Remenants of work I have done, hacks and whacks taken at data and problems
that is better shared and easily taken up by others. Maybe your search
engine of choice can pick these up so you don't have to spend 30 minutes or so
hacking up something trivial and instead can do something more enjoyable.
